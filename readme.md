# Quizler Game

This game was originally built on Day 17 and Day 34, as part of the [100 Days of Python Udemy Course](https://github.com/RamenJunkie/100-Days-of-Code-Python-Udemy-Course). I am updating it to add more features to make it more complete.  Specifically:

* Add a button at the end of the game to replay.
* ~~Add the ability to select options at the start of the game~~
* Add a "Title Screen" (Just because)
* Create a stand alone app version.

Questions are pulled from Open Trivia.

To run, simply run main.py and everything should just go.

TO FIX:
* Currently the options page mostly works, but needs updated to add a check for when a particular topic has no questions available, which currently breaks the program.  
* It also breaks with "Any Category" which needs to be corrected by adding special conditions ot match the API.
* Add some comments to your code man, it's better practice!


### This is still a work in progress.
